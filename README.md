### Abstract
The cholinergic system is essential for memory. While degradation of cholinergic pathways characterizes 
memory-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, the neurophysiological mechanisms linking the 
cholinergic system to human memory remain unknown. Here, combining intracranial brain recordings with 
pharmacological manipulation, we describe the neurophysiological effects of a cholinergic blocker, 
scopolamine, on the human hippocampal formation during episodic memory. We found that the memory impairment 
caused by scopolamine was coupled to disruptions of both the amplitude and phase alignment of 
theta oscillations (2-10 Hz) during encoding. Across individuals, the severity of theta phase disruption
correlated with the magnitude of memory impairment. Further, cholinergic blockade disrupted connectivity
within the hippocampal formation. Our results indicate that cholinergic circuits support memory by coordinating
the temporal dynamics of theta oscillations across the hippocampal formation. These findings expand our mechanistic
understanding of the neurophysiology of human memory and offer insights into potential treatments for memory-related disorders.
